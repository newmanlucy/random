# Why Isn’t Diversity and Inclusion Working? #

Tuesday, a user of Microsoft internal blog posted the following “diversity poll”: “Which group is the smartest at MS?” The available options were Americans and Canadians, Indians, Eastern Europeans and Russians, Chinese, Israelis / Jewish, and Western Europeans. Eighty-five Microsoft employees voted. There was no clear consensus.

That this poll was posted, and that eighty-five employees did not hesitate to chose a “smartest” among a collection of demographic groups (which by the way are not mutually exclusive and leaves out several continents), suggests that the depth of the diversity and inclusion problem in corporate tech goes far beyond lagging numbers among certain demographic groups. Rather, the problem is rooted in employees’ beliefs, which inform the extent of their respect for coworkers, and colors employee interactions.

I am a college computer science student. A good friend of mine works at Microsoft. He loves technology, microsoft, and many of his coworkers. But the poll discussed above is only the tip of an iceberg of inclusion issues he regularly sees.

After reading Karen Ho’s Liquidated: An Ethnography of Wall Street for a sociology class, which discusses the causes and implications of Wall Street culture on banking practices, I interviewed my friend on his experiences for a class paper. This problem is not limited to Microsoft, but Microsoft is used as a case study here, since I have most information on it.

## The problem ##
Tech in general, and Microsoft in particular, brands itself as “the future.” They create the technology that powers tomorrow, by empowering their employees today. If you Google “Microsoft Diversity,” you will disappointing [statistics] -- a majority of technical employees, and a higher majority of executives, are white, and there are many more men than women. You’ll also find optimistic [statements] by Diversity and Inclusion coordinator Gwen Houston, that we’re gaining half a percent of this or that demographic, here and there. There’s a lot more to be done, but efforts are paying off, Houston says. 

You may also find a link to an article about Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s 2015 “[gaffe].” Rather than asking for a raise when they deserve it, he said women should have “faith in the system” and wait for “karma” to give them a raise. While he apologized in the face of public backlash, this comment seems more an indication of a problematic underlying attitude which could inform daily interactions, than a thoughtless gaffe.

This attitude in which demographics, rather than pure meritocracy, influence coworker relations and respect is further seen in manager hiring practices. Discussing a psychology study on ingroup biases, my friend told me of ingroup biases at Microsoft. He says, “Indians like to hire indians on their teams. And White guys like to hire white guys on their teams. And since there aren’t a lot of Asian managers for some reason, there aren’t a lot of totally Asian teams.” He later amended that Microsoft’s Bing subdivision is almost entirely comprised of Asian males. He suspects that he was hired in part because his demographic is similar to his manager’s.  If true, such hiring practices represent an attempt to preserve familiar cultural values and hierarchies. 

My friend sees social biases come up on a daily basis in meetings, as older men cut off young women with uncanny regularity. Rather than allowing these women to explain an engineering problem, men will often interrupt with their own solution before they understand the issue. This takes extra time in meetings, because the men’s solution often misinterprets the problem. He finds himself pointing the men who interrupted back towards the women’s explanations. This pattern of interruption displays a fundamental lack of respect, and again suggests that there are factors beyond technical merit which influence the extent to which an employee is taken seriously.


Microsoft clearly sees the problem. Following Nadella’s misstatement, the company has taken aggressive steps towards diversity and inclusion, including [employee training] and [financial incentives] for promoting minorities and women. My friend describes the Diversity and Inclusion posters ubiquitous on the walls of Microsoft buildings: “There are a lot of big, minimalistic lettering saying things like, ‘7 out of 10 disabilities are invisible to the eye.’ There’s a poster with two different-colored atoms to represent diversity. It’s a lot of abstract art.” So there’s a lot of symbolism and idealistic imagery, and then, in the diversity and inclusion training program, employees are told, “Play nicely, children,” in so many words.

## The Reasons 
### 1. The Hiring and Promotion Incentive Isn’t Working. ###
Microsoft managers are given incentives for hiring and promoting minorities. But this incentive allows managers to reap financial rewards without internalizing the sentiment that all employees should be respected equally based on merit. He feels that his manager may be trying to make him look better than he deserves simply for the sake of this incentive. He doesn’t know how else to explain his manager having given him credit for a feature he didn’t implement. 

Further, a financial incentive for hiring and promotion of minorities leaves room for others to further call into question the legitimacy of a minority’s power. On the anonymous forum open only to Microsoft employees (not company sponsored), one user says, “As long as there is a forced ‘diversity and inclusion’ program at Microsoft you will always be seen as a diversity hire. Live with it. Trump 2020!” Another says, “Yeah due to the forced diversity numbers, I do look at all minority and women as diversity hires.. It’s the only logical thing to do..”

### 2. Current Biases Amplify Themselves. ###
According to my friend, managers at Microsoft tend to hire people of their demographic ingroup. This perpetuates hierarchies particular to Indian, White, or Asian cultures, which have no place in a work environment. On my friend’s team, “The culture is pretty male-dominated.” One poll on the anonymous forum shows that many men want the woman they marry to change their last name to his. While supporting this particular custom may have no bearing on professional treatment of co-workers, it is an attitude of unequal treatment which may carry over. And based on his experience with men interrupting women more often, it does.

The diversity hiring incentive is Microsoft’s attempt to combat this issue. But rather than removing social hierarchies, women and minorities are now seen by some as “diversity hires.” This attitude is visible on the anonymous forum and just below the surface in everyday interactions.

The anonymous blog itself further perpetuates the problems. Anonymity and lack of moderation allow employees to say things that would get them fired if said out loud at work. This allows others to nod their heads, to like and comment, when a vocal minority expresses opinions that are simply unacceptable. Ideas that should be extremist are legitimized by the fact that people can say them on the forum without any real consequences.

### 3. An Opaque Rewards System Leaves Too Much Up To Managers. ###
Managers at Microsoft have a lot of power, in part because their reasons for promotion and bonuses are not visible to employees. Managers keep track of numbers throughout the year: bug fixes, code pushed, etc. All of this eventually goes into a performance history called Connect. From there, employees get their “rewards,” a number  which determines the size of their bonuses and whether they can get a promotion. Or, if an employee gets “zero rewards,” they should look for a new job externally, as they are likely to be laid off, and the “ZR” mark on their record will make it very hard to get hired to another team at Microsoft.	

But employees never have access to the Connect performance history which determines their rewards. “We don’t have a UI for viewing it,” my friend says. Well, this is Microsoft. How hard would it be to build a UI for this database?

Lack of access to these reports allows managers to make decisions that affect employees’ careers, without those employees knowing why the decisions were made. Basically, they can say whatever they want. My friend tells me of rare instances where a really strong employee is given zero rewards, just so that the can be kept on the team, since other managers then won’t hire them. Likely more common is managers allowing their personal biases to color how they review their employees’ work. Without knowing why they got lower rewards, employees are relatively powerless to affect decisions that have profound impact on their careers.

## What Do We Do? ##
The current solutions to diversity and inclusion problems at Microsoft have some serious issues. But there’s no easy solution. People have biases which affect how they interact with others, even in a professional setting, where technical competence should theoretically be the only thing that matters. I point to a few things to look at here. 

- Microsoft and others should take a look at their diversity hiring and promotion structures to make sure that the desired effects are being achieved, and rethink the policy, if not. 
- Integration within teams, rather than diversity in the company as a whole, should be emphasized.
- Blind, the company that developed Microsoft’s anonymous forum, should consider implementing a more effective moderation system. 
- And, crucially, Microsoft should make its rewards system more transparent, so that employees know exactly how they are doing, and exactly what they need to do in order to advance their careers. 

Of course, don’t just listen to me. I’m just a college student whose main source is an unnamed friend. We need more people to share their perspectives, and we need thoughtful discussion on the nature and root of these issues, as well as their potential solutions. I hope to work for a company like Microsoft upon graduation. So it’s of utmost importance to me, for myself as well as for humanity, that we work together to solve these problems.
